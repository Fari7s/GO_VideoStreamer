Description:
Simple GO video streaming service, part of my mini-portfolio. 

Main features:

-Video fragmentization in to 10-sec .ts batches.

-FFmpeg encoding, hardcoded settings: quality: 360p, 540p, 720p (changeble in code, you can add your own inside HSL gen function), H264 compression, .mp4, 30-GOP.

-Simple GO service, localhost:8080 only

Future Plans:
Since I have no interest in web development or Go, there are no plans to complete or support this project any further.
